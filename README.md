Our program includes:

- support with free consulting (online & offline) to help with all the bureaucracy 
- membership in a collective of digital professionals and help with finding customers and partners to make self employment sustainable

## Our goals and values

### Open Organisation & Transparency
  * Our processes, finances and organization are completely transparent.
  * Our project is part of [SquatUp - open collective](https://github.com/squatup).

### Open Culture of Collaboration
  * We introduce newcomers to different state-of-the-art tools & methods for self-directed collaboration.
  * Individuals are encouraged to collaborate on projects & to invite others to join their projects.

### Open Source & Sharing
  * We create a knowledge sharing movement.
  * Newcomers share progress and questions openly to inspire others and to get feedback from their peers.
  * All our learning materials are also available for free and we hope for an open debate and contributions from the community.
  
### Literacy
  * Programming (coding) is a new literacy. All the jobs in the future will include some level of programming.
  * We mentor newcomers to become literate in developing and deploying solutions for tomorrow.

### Inclusiveness
  * RefugeesWork connects all genders, backgrounds, experience levels & age in an open and safe learning and collaborative environment.
  * We support the [Berlin Code of Conduct](http://berlincodeofconduct.org/) and humble & friendly communication, so no one feels shy asking any questions.

### "Do It Yourself" Spirit
  * Visible progress is the best motivator for success so newcomers are empowered to kickstart their self-employment.
  * We teach newcomers quick organized prototyping and encourage entrepreneurial thinking and a hands-on approach.
