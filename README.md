All our communication happens here - [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/RefugeesWork/Chat)

# Mission
**[`Refugeeswork.com`](www.refugeeswork.com) is a mobile friendly app for newcomers to find freelance work**  
We build a tool that empowers people with an entrepreneurial spirit to kickstart their self employment, develop their skills and get paid for it. Our program includes:

1. bootstrapping a new self employed existance by creating a business plan starting from just an idea
* supporting them with free consulting (online & offline) to help with all the bureaucracy and legal oblications, like "open a bank account", "register for a taxnumber", "do accounting and annual tax returns", etc.
* helping them to start their operations, which includes finding customers and partners to make their self employment sustainable
