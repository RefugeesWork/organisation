## RefugeesWork - Onboarding :-)

---

### 1. => [Check our service (refugeeswork.com)](http://www.refugeeswork.com/)

### 2. => [Meet us online :-)](https://gitter.im/RefugeesWork/Chat)

### 3. => [Join our mission](https://waffle.io/RefugeesWork/organization/cards/577a7e8fd4e2435b012bba41)
#### Our **mission** is structured into
* several `activity fields`, each with it's own `goal`
* and attached `TASKS`, which are either:
  * `ideas` as normal bullet points => feel free to add/refine them
  * `issues` as linked bullet points => feel free to **just do them** :-)

You can involve yourself as much as you can afford. Feel free to start contributing :-)

1. we work on the **MISSION** card in the `Overview`  column to see the big picture
* Everything that is blocked from executions for reasons is put in `onHold/followUp`
* The `(ready)TASKS` is sorted by **priority**,  do tasks on the top first
* When doing tasks assigned by you or others to you, drag them to `Work in progress`
* After finishing, inform others on the [chat](https://gitter.im/RefugeesWork/Chat) and drag them to `Review/Feedback`
* Finished or Canceled Tasks are dragged into `Done/General Archive`

#### **Reward**
We brainstorm [here](https://waffle.io/RefugeesWork/organization/cards/5783ea22161d801500031773) about our **business model** and how to keep a **work journal** of who did what and how many **POINTS** you earn for executing tasks on the waffle board.

One next main step for us is to define how much POINTS you can earn by doing a task on the waffle board. For now it's points, but later - if there will ever be revenue, that should be converted into money - so the points are somehow like shares. How exactly - we dont know yet - but the goal is, that every little bit of work will be rewarded. Ideas are welcome - So please help us figure out how to do that best :-)

*...otherwise, if you work on similar stuff, or clicked all the above already and have compatible ideas not directly related to the "refugeeswork" mission, or you want to learn even more about us, check our umbrella initiative [SquatUp](https://github.com/SquatUp), which lists all our [Partner Projects](https://waffle.io/SquatUp/roadmap) about which [we chat every friday evening](https://gitter.im/SquatUp/roadmap) to brainstorm about the bigger picture in general :-)*
