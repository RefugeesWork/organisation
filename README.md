# Refugeeswork.com 
is a tool for newcomers to find freelance work

[refugeeswork.com](http://www.refugeeswork.com)

Our program is **online** and for **free**. It empowers people with an entrepreneurial spirit to kickstart their self employment, develop their skills and get paid for it. 

It includes:

* bootstrapping a new self employed existance by creating a business plan starting from just an idea
* supporting them with free consulting (online & offline) to help with all the bureaucracy and legal oblications, like "open a bank account", "register for a taxnumber", "do accounting and annual tax returns", etc...
* helping them to start their operations, which includes finding customers and partners to make their self employment sustainable

To help newcomers become successful freelancer/solopreneur, we also created a [Wizard Amigos e-school for programming](http://wizardamigos.com) and meetups, where learners can meet with other learners and more experience developers (see [Coding Amigos] (http://www.meetup.com/codingamigos)).
