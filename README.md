## RefugeesWork - Onboarding :-)

---

### 1. => [Check our service (refugeeswork.com)](http://www.refugeeswork.com/)

### 2. => [Meet us online :-)](https://gitter.im/RefugeesWork/Chat)

### 3. => [Join our mission](https://waffle.io/RefugeesWork/organization/cards/577a7e8fd4e2435b012bba41)
#### Our **mission** is structured into
* several `activity fields`, each with it's own `goal`
* and attached `TASKS`, which are either:
  * `ideas` as normal bullet points => feel free to add/refine them
  * `issues` as linked bullet points => feel free to **just do them** :-)

You can involve yourself as much as you can afford. Feel free to start contributing :-)

*...otherwise, if you work on similar stuff, or clicked all the above already and have compatible ideas not directly related to the "refugeeswork" mission, or you want to learn even more about us, check our umbrella initiative [SquatUp](https://github.com/SquatUp), which lists all our [Partner Projects](https://waffle.io/SquatUp/roadmap) about which [we chat every friday evening](https://gitter.im/SquatUp/roadmap) to brainstorm about the bigger picture in general :-)*
